<p class="text-center">I guess I could say I have many hobbies, but I would classify them as interests currently as I have not been active recently with them. I do not have a preference between indoor and outdoor activities as I enjoy both just as much as the other. Growing up my family went to the beach every summer so swimming, skimboarding, and surfing are a few of my favorite outdoor activities. I havn't been to the beach for the past few years, but hopefully I can change that in the coming months or no later then the summer of 2024.<br>I enjoy building things. The desk in my room was a project my brother and I completed earlier this year, and the computer I currently use is one I have had for the past 4-5 years. It is the 2nd PC I have assembled so far, and I am looking into possibly building my third depending on the state of the hardware as we close out 2023. If you have kept up with this recently, then you would understand the pricing spike certain components experienced and it hasn't been until more recently that my current GPU has started to see new games really push its capabilities at higher settings.
