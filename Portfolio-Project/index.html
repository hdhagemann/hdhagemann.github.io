  	    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome To My Website</h1>
        <p class="text-center">Hello! You may know me as Henry, but I go by Dalton which is my middle name. It is very nice to meet you all and hopefully this website leaves a pleasant impression. As we followed along with the textbook I quickly grew dissatisfied with the overall appearance of the website, and I wanted to experiment with the tools provided through dreamweaver while also looking for other resources to learn from. This landing page / index page was the result of me following along with a video I found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBbGMBZlU">&nbsp;YouTube.</a> The following pages are a result of taking what I learned from the textbook along with the video and applying them to present the content to you all. I will agree that this home page is "busy", All of the pictures are my own except the one photo of the individual holding a phone. The photos cover a range of events from going to a NFL game in Baltimore, my personal computer setup at home, a sunset on Jekyll Island where I used to work, and lastly my trip to Europe.<br> Initially I had an about me page, but I figured it would be better to include some of that information here, and create a dedicated contact page for the future. As I am still studying in school I do not have a lot of information to market myself to potential employers, but it is what I will be working on moving forward.<br> In the dropdown menu below, I have included more information about the photos I posted above and more information about myself.

              <div class="card-body">The number of times I have typed and started over trying to write out this experience is laughable. Maybe another time I will provide a detailed report or blog post about my trip and how it all came to be but trying to summarize it while keeping it all relevant is challenging. I have the utmost respect for all writers out there. Now, on we travel to Europe.<br><br>I took two trips to Hungary, the first lasted about a week, and the second lasted nearly two months. Although this was a trip to Europe, the main reasoning behind these trips was that my girlfriend at the time lived in Hungary although we worked together in Georgia prior to her moving back to Europe. This first visit to Hungary; we visited Budapest, and it is a beautiful city. The history behind the name of the city was something that stood out to me more so than all of the sights I saw. Budapest was not always “Budapest” as we know, the city itself is divided in half by the Danube River and eastern part of the city is known as Pest whereas the western part is called Buda. Hungary has centuries of history, and it wasn’t until the 1870’s that the two towns unified becoming Budapest. Now I do have a gripe with this city as the few occasions we took a train to the city, it was cold and rainy each time. It didn’t make for the best conditions despite the sun and clear skies in the photos above. That was the only day out of seven or eight days of us being there that it was sunny. Another interesting point is that the city itself has an older feel to it. If you were to picture an American city and think if that is what the capital of a European country would look like, then you’re wrong. There aren’t large skyscrapers or modern 20-floor buildings. Maybe in another country like England or Germany? I am guessing here, but at least for Budapest, the city itself does not stray from its history.<br><br>As for the last photo, that picture was taken at Rab Island which is located in the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Croatia. This was the clearest water I have ever experienced. I could look down while swimming and see the seafloor 20-feet under me clearly! I’m used to being at the beaches here in North Carolina and South Carolina in murky green water and wondering “what just touched my foot?”. I know I didn’t give out too much detail about the whole experience, but I am struggling to not write paragraphs on end about this. One thing I wanted to try and say using this as an example is that if you have the chance to do something memorable and exciting, do it. I am 26, it is now 2023, and I earned my AS back in 2017. I regret a lot of decision I made in between then and now as I feel I have wasted so much time of my life, but not once have I ever regretted the decisions that led me to visiting Europe.</div>

              <div class="card-body">As I mentioned in the previous tab, I moved to Georgia as it was an opportuniy for work from the company I had been working for here in Raleigh. Initially I was only planning to work for the summer and return to North Carolina to continue my education at ECU. But like all plans, they never work out. The main factors that led to me not immediately returning to North Carolina was that I was living on my own for the first time, and the overall experience was enjoyable. It also helped that the company I was working for was the best employer I have ever had, thank you <a href="https://www.jekyllclub.com/jekyll-ocean-club/?NCK=8442016871&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1_SkBhDwARIsANbGpFsF15hwnKKJb3sMFDUkdAAWyWxiZiMTUjUZR3gZvWACCWFCXH9LJQoaAkXqEALw_wcB"> Jekyll Ocean Club</a> and <a href="https://www.nvhg.com/">Northview Hotel Group</a>for the experience and all that I was able to learn while working there. Here in Raleigh I had always worked in restaurants, but on Jekyll Island I worked as a guest services agent and eventually as a supervisor at the hotel until I moved to Wyoming following another work opportunity.</div>

Maybe that is an exaggeration, but my family is passionate about our hometown teams. The first Baltimore Ravens game I attended was a birthday present I purchased for my mom, and that experience started my love for attending games. The picture above was from the 2019 season where the team went 14-2 overall after starting 2-2 on the season. This would be the fourth win in their eventual twelve game winning streak to close out the regular season. This game was also the final game where the Ravens faced Tom Brady as a player for the New England Patriots. As this is written in 2023, this is accurate for the time being.</div>
